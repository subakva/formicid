------------------------------------------------
Bootstrap Build
------------------------------------------------

Most of Formicid's build process is defined in a Formicid build file, but in order to execute it, you need to compile Formicid once. bootstrap.xml in the project root folder is an Ant build script to compile Formicid into the build/classes directory.

$ ./bin/bootstrap.sh
 - or -
C:\> bin/bootstrap.bat

------------------------------------------------
Running the Formicid Build
------------------------------------------------

Once the project has been built once, the Formicid build file, build.js can be executed by running the script in the bin directory.

$ ./bin/formicid.sh
 - or -
C:\> bin/formicid.bat
